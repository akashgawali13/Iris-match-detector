Iris-match-detector

A Streamlit web app that uses a Siamese Neural Network to verify if two iris images belong to the same person or different person.


## 🚀 About the project

This project demonstrates biometric verification using iris images. It employs a Siamese Neural Network built with TensorFlow & Keras to compare two grayscale iris images and predict whether they belong to the same individual.

The app features:
- 📊 Deep learning model (Siamese network) for one-shot learning.
- 🖥️ Streamlit frontend with custom CSS for a polished look.
- 🔍 Upload two iris images to verify identity.
- 📈 Displays prediction confidence with intuitive visuals.
